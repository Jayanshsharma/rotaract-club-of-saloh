He will be declared the president-nominee on 1 October if

                                    <br> “The clubs are where Rotary happens,” says Maloney, an attorney. He aims to support and strengthen clubs at the community level, preserve Rotary’s culture as a service-oriented membership organization, and test
                                    new regional approaches for growth. “With the eradication of polio, recognition for Rotary will be great and the opportunities will be many,” he says. “We have the potential to become the global powerhouse for doing
                                    good.” Maloney is a principal in the law firm of Blackburn, Maloney, and Schuppert LLC, with a focus on taxation, estate planning, and agricultural law. He represents large farming operations in the Southeastern and

                                    Law Institute. He has been active in Decatur’s religious community, chairing his church’s finance council and a local Catholic school board. He has also served as president of the Community Foundation of Greater Decatur,
                                    chair of Morgan County Meals on Wheels, and director of the United Way of Morgan County and the Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce. A Rotarian since 1980, Maloney has served as an RI director; Foundation trustee
                                    and vice chair; and aide to 2003-04 RI President Jonathan Majiyagbe. He also has participated in the Council on Legislation as chair, vice chair, parliamentarian, and trainer. He was an adviser to the 2004 Osaka Convention
                                    Committee and chaired the 2014 Sydney Convention Committee. Prior to serving as a district governor, Maloney led a Group Study Exchange to Nigeria. He also served as Future Vision Committee vice chair; Foundation training

Mehta acknowledges that current membership trends are a
                                    challenge and says that membership development should be Rotary’s highest priority. He believes that focusing on regional plans, successfully transitioning Rotaractors into Rotary clubs, and increasing diversity and
                                    female members could yield a 5 percent net growth in membership each year. “A major brainstorming is needed to find effective solutions suited to different areas of the world,” says Mehta. He adds that regional ethos
                                    and culture have to be taken into account to find localized solutions, as “one size does not fit all.” He believes Rotary can extend to new geographical areas and countries. As a strong proponent of Rotary’s strategic
                                    plan, Mehta says he will encourage clubs to use action plans and reinforce the core values of Rotary. Mehta says Rotary needs to become more contemporary and adaptable by focusing on partnerships with governments and
                                    corporations, expanding partnerships with organizations that specialize in Rotary’s areas of focus, and investing in technology. Mehta, an accountant, is chair of the Skyline Group, a real estate development company
                                    he founded. He is also a director of Operation Eyesight Universal (India), a Canada-based organization. Mehta has been actively involved in disaster response and is a trustee of ShelterBox, UK. After the 2004 Indian

                                <br>
                                <p style="color:#000; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">Jennifer E. Jones, a member of the Rotary Club of Windsor-Roseland, Ontario, Canada, has been nominated to become Rotary International’s president for 2022-23, a groundbreaking selection that will make her the first woman
                                    to hold that office in the organization’s 115-year history. Jones will officially become president-nominee on 1 October if no other candidates challenge her. Jones says she sees Rotary’s Action Plan as a catalyst for
                                    increasing Rotary’s impact. “As we reflect upon our new strategic priorities, we could have never envisioned that our ability to adapt would become our North Star during what is inarguably the most profound time in
                                    recent history,” Jones said in her vision statement. “Silver linings rise out of the most challenging circumstances. Using metric-driven goals, I will harness this historic landscape to innovate, educate, and communicate
                                    opportunities that reflect today’s reality.” As the first woman to be nominated to be president, Jones understands how important it is to follow through on Rotary’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement.
                                    “I believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion … begins at the top and for us to realize growth in female membership and members under the age of forty — these demographics need to see their own reflection in leadership,”
                                    Jones said. “I will champion double-digit growth in both categories while never losing sight of our entire family.” Jones is founder and president of Media Street Productions Inc., an award-winning media company in
                                    Windsor. She was chair of the board of governors of the University of Windsor and chair of the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce. She has been recognized for her service with the YMCA Peace Medallion, the Queen’s
                                    Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Wayne State University’s Peacemaker of the Year Award, a first for a Canadian. Jones holds a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). A current Rotary Foundation trustee, Jones has been a Rotary member since
                                    1997 and has served Rotary as RI vice president, director, training leader, committee chair, moderator, and district governor. She played a lead role in Rotary’s rebranding effort by serving as chair of the Strengthening
                                    Rotary’s Advisory Group. She is the co-chair of the End Polio Now Countdown to History Campaign Committee, which aims to raise $150 million for polio eradication efforts. Jones recently led the successful #RotaryResponds
                                    telethon, which raised critical funds for COVID-19 relief and was viewed by more than 65,000. Jones has also received Rotary International’s Service Above Self Award and The Rotary Foundation Citation for Meritorious
                                    Service. She and her husband, Nick Krayacich, are members of The Rotary Foundation’s Arch Klumph Society, Paul Harris Society, and the Bequest Society. The members of the Nominating Committee for the 2022-23 President
